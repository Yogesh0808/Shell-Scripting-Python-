# Keywords in Python

Keywords in Python are reserved words that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (names of variables, functions, etc.). These words are part of the Python language syntax.

## List of Python Keywords
- Python has 35 keywords (as of Python 3.x). Here is the complete list:

    ```python
    False      await      else      import      pass
    None       break      except    in          raise
    True       class      finally   is          return
    and        continue   for       lambda      try
    as         def        from      nonlocal    while
    assert     del        global    not         with
    async      elif       if        or          yield

#### Explanation of Common Keywords

1. False: Represents the boolean value False.
2. None: Represents the null value or no value.
3. True: Represents the boolean value True.
4. and: A logical operator used to combine conditional statements.
5. as: Used to create an alias while importing a module (e.g., import numpy as np).
6. assert: Used for debugging purposes to check if a condition is true.
7. break: Exits from a loop (e.g., for or while loop).
8. class: Used to define a class in Python.
9. continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one.
10. def: Used to define a function.
11. del: Deletes a variable or object.
12. elif: Used in conditional statements, it means "else if".
13. else: Defines the block of code to be executed if the condition is not true in an if statement.
14. except: Used in error handling to catch exceptions.
15. finally: A block of code that runs after the try block, regardless of whether an exception was raised.
16. for: Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list or range).
17. from: Used to import specific items from a module.
18. global: Declares a variable as global, allowing it to be used across different scopes.
19. if: Used for conditional statements.
20. import: Used to import modules.
21. in: Checks if a value exists in a sequence (e.g., a list).
22. is: Tests object identity, checks if two variables refer to the same object.
23. lambda: Used to create an anonymous function (i.e., a function without a name).
24. nonlocal: Used to declare a variable as nonlocal, meaning itâ€™s neither local nor global.
25. not: A logical operator used to invert a condition.
26. or: A logical operator used to combine conditions.
27. pass: A null operation used as a placeholder in loops, functions, or classes.
28. raise: Used to raise an exception.
29. return: Exits from a function and optionally returns a value.
30. try: Defines a block of code where exceptions are caught and handled.
31. while: Used to create a loop that continues until a specified condition is false.
32. with: Used to simplify exception handling with resources (e.g., files).
33. yield: Used in a function to return a generator.
34. async: Declares an asynchronous function or code block.
35. await: Pauses the execution of an asynchronous function and waits for the result.
