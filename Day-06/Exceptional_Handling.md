# Exceptional Handling in Python

Exceptional handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage errors that might occur during program execution. This prevents your program from crashing unexpectedly and provides a way to handle errors in a controlled manner.

**Key Concepts**

* **`try` Block:**
    - Contains the code that might potentially raise an exception.
* **`except` Block:**
    - Contains the code that will be executed if an exception of a specific type occurs within the `try` block.

**Common Error Types**

* **`ZeroDivisionError`:** Occurs when you attempt to divide a number by zero.
* **`SyntaxError`:** Occurs when the code violates the rules of Python syntax (e.g., missing parentheses, incorrect indentation).
* **`PermissionError`:** Occurs when the program tries to access a file or resource that it doesn't have permission to access.
* **`TypeError`:** Occurs when an operation is performed on an object of the wrong data type.
* **`ValueError`:** Occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but with an inappropriate value.
* **`IndexError`:** Occurs when you try to access an element in a list or other sequence using an invalid index.

**Example**

```python
try:
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 0
    result = num1 / num2
    print(result)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero.")

except Exception as e:  # Catch all other exceptions
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
